Done
    * test in popular browsers (desktop and mobile)
    * add tablecloth to tray
    * discard food textures not appropiate for a picnic
    * Notify: ¡DEFEND THE FOOD FROM THE ANTS ATTACK!
    * sites to download free imagenes/sprites
    * improve time to react 
        * place food at vertical center in order to have more time to react for top and botoom ants
        * climbing time
    * Instructions/Presentation Scene (for explain "tilt controls" and to go full screen)
    * apply ants images/sprites
    * Safari Iphone accelerometer. nope, discarting those devices
    * screen dim cause no touch events (it is solved by itself with native app, also later will be buttons for attacks)
    * Already exists exact the same game?
    * screen margins and correct full screen (sizes, scales, etc)
    * set landscape game
    * many brains
    * device rotation to portrait

Ideas:
    Gameplay
        probar concepto de robarse comida !!!!
        different ants types 
        ants falling
        powers to defend food:
            to kill ants: insecticida, golpe dedo,
            to throw antes outside: tilt phone, soplar, shake the bandeja, 
            temporal frogger that eats ants with its tongue!!!!
            ant traps (or mines that explode when ants pass)
    levels
        difficulty: maybe last some time with some food quantity killing some ants quantity
        themes: picnic, picada, sushi, macdonals, birthday, candies, junk food, snacks, vegetables/fruits,

doubts
    chase food: I want to make enemies that behave something like "Boo" from Mario Bros: that is, enemies that chase the player wherever it goes , after achieve this I want these enemies-chase-movement being affected by the gravity (the gravity will be controller by the player). Any Idea?
